Parameter Estimation and Classification using Naive Bayesian Network: A Case Study on Breast Cancer Dataset
This Project focuses on the second part of the project, which involves estimating the parameters for the conditional probability distributions in the naive Bayesian network using the Bayesian approach with Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation. The prior distribution is specified, and the results of the error analysis and parameter estimates are reported.
